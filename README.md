### Hi there, I'm Andrei ğŸ‘‹

I am a 21 years old Junior Web Developer from Romania.<br>
I am also a graduate student from Ovidius University of Constanta.<br>
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I'm always open to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.<br>
